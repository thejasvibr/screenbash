### Screen Basher App

What is the highest tap-rate you can achieve, with one finger, with two and with all five? 
Try it out and compete with your friends!! 

My first attempts at making a [Kivy](https://kivy.org/#home) based app for use on desktop and Android devices. 

#### Installation
* Go to the ```bin/``` folder and download the .apk file using your Android phone 
* You will need to enable installation from unknown sources. Check [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish#unknown-sources) 
* If the instructions in the link abovve don't seem to match with what's on your phone, [Google]() up the instructions for your particular model.


Let me know how you liked the app. Ping me by email (thejasvib@gmail.com), Twitter (@BeleyurThejasvi) or yell out your feelings from a safe distance.
